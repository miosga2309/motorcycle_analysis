# Informed purchase of a motorcycle
This project is supposed to be an analysis of the current motorcycle market with regard to a few models I might be interested in to buy for myself. All motorcycles are more or less classic bikes or scramblers, have two cylinders and ABS.

## Models:
- Ducati Scrambler Icon Dark
- Ducati Scrambler Icon
- Ducati Scrambler Sixty2
- Moto Guzzi V7 III
- Moto Guzzi V9
- Royal Enfield Interceptor 650
- Yamaha XSR 700

## Progress:
**29/08/2020**: I have requested API keys for two car and motorcycle market places in the German area, [mobile](https://www.mobile.de/) and [autoscout24](https://www.autoscout24.de/).

**31/08/2020**: Testing a probably less stable version of information access by scraping the webpage with certain results manually, using beautifulsoup in Python. **UPDATE**: [mobile](https://www.mobile.de/) does not allow for that kind of scraping. It explicitly states that one has to use the API provided by them. Perhaps there are ways to bypass the defense mechanisms but let's wait for their reply on my API key request.
